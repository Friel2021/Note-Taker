# Note-Taker

[Note Taker on Heroku!](https://safe-falls-60671.herokuapp.com//)

This is a note taking application using Express and Node.js. This application has functionality to add, view, and delete notes that are being stored in a db.json file.

This application requires the following NPM modules:

fs
Express
Path
Be sure to install npm packages that aren't already included in node.

The initial page will take you to a welcome/get started page, once you click into get started you can start creating your notes!

There are input boxes for both a note title and note text and a save button that pops up in the upper right hand corner of the page once text has been entered. Once a new note is saved it will then show up by title on the left hand side of the page. There will be a red trash can delete button next to each note so that you can delete them. If you click on the note title itself it will pull that note title and text up to the center of the screen.
